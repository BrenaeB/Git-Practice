# Git-Practice
## Description
This project is just Git practice. In the meantime here's a little bit about me. I'm just a chill girl who loves to listen to music, take photographs of things that appeal to me, and enjoys warm potato salad, if prepared correctly.

## A Few Fun Facts
- I'm currently learning hot to speak German.
- I have like to listen to The Delfonics when I'm working in my shed.
- I secretly want to run a DND campaign.
